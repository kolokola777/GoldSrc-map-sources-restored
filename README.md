# GoldSrc Map Sources Restored

This repository contains restored, cleaned, and fixed `.rmf` source files for classic GoldSrc maps.  
Maps were decompiled, manually repaired (brushwork, textures, entities), and prepared for use in editors like J.A.C.K or Valve Hammer Editor.

## Purpose

To provide modders, mappers, and enthusiasts with editable versions of GoldSrc maps.

## Notes

- All maps were restored from decompiled `.bsp` files.
- Common bugs like invalid brushes, misaligned textures, and broken entities were manually fixed.
- Original game logic and layout are preserved as much as possible.
